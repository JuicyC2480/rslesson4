    <p>But validating can help a lot! To validate means we try to understand and accept someone else's feelings. It's something each of us can do—even when there's not a whole lot we can do to help the rest of the situation.</p>
    <p>Here's how you can practice validating.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Listen.</b> Sometimes when a person is talking, we spend the whole time thinking about what we're going to say next. Especially if we've contributed to the problem, it can be easy to feel defensive and want to argue. Try to let that go and just carefully listen.</li>
      <li><b>Try to understand.</b>Politely ask clarifying questions to better understand what they are feeling. Do your best to put yourself in their shoes. Try to see life from their point of view.</li>
      <li><b>Accept the person's feelings.</b> Events affect different people in different ways. Don't argue with someone about how they're feeling or judge them for feeling a certain way.</li>
      <li><b>Show compassion.</b>Make sure they know that, even though you can't perfectly understand what they're going through, you care about them. Say things like, “I'm sorry you are going through this. It sounds so hard.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As is true with everything, this pattern gets easier with practice. The world needs more valiant validators like you!</p>
    <p>Pick one of the steps above to particularly focus on for a while.</p><b>Article Reference</b>

      <li>“My dear brothers and sisters, how we treat each other really matters! How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully. “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy”10 that we can say about another person—whether to his face or behind her back—that should be our standard of communication.</li>
      <li>"If a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions."</li>
      <li>If a friend on social media has strong political or social views that violate everything you believe in, an angry, cutting retort by you will not help. Building bridges of understanding will require much more of you, but that is exactly what your friend needs.”</li>
